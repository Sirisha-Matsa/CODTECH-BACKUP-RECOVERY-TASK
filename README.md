# OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

*****PROJECT:DATABASE BACKUP & RECOVERY*****

# OBJECTIVE:

The objective is to ensure data integrity and continuity by implementing reliable backup and recovery processes for database tables. This includes capturing table structure and data, generating reusable SQL scripts for backups, and verifying successful restoration through table structure checks, data validation, and row count comparison after recovery.

# KEY COMPONENTS:

**1. Backup Components**

***a. Table Structure:***

  Command: SHOW CREATE TABLE users;
    
  Purpose:
  
  * Captures the structure of the users table (columns, data types, constraints, keys, etc.).
  * Ensures the table can be recreated exactly as it was in case of data loss or corruption.

  ***b. Table Data***

  command:SELECT CONCAT('INSERT INTO users(id,name,email,created_at)VALUES(',id, ',\'',name,'\', \'',email,'\', \'',created_at,'\');')AS backup_query FROM users;

  Purpose:
  
  * Extracts all the rows from the users table as INSERT statements.
  * Provides a logical backup of the data for later restoration.

  **2. Recovery Components**
  
***a.Table Structure Verification***

  Command: DESCRIBE users;
  
  Purpose:
  
  * Confirms that the restored table's structure matches the original table.
  * Ensures all columns, data types, and constraints are in place before restoring data.

***b. Data Validation***

  Command: SELECT * FROM users;
  
  Purpose:
  
  * Checks the rows in the restored table to ensure data accuracy.
  * Allows manual inspection of recovered data for correctness.

***c. Row Count Verification***

  Command: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM users;
  
  Purpose:
  
  * Validates the number of records restored matches the original table.
  * Provides a quick way to detect missing or extra rows.

**3. Workflow and Automation**

**Logical Backup**

******Generates SQL scripts for:******

  * CREATE TABLE (structure backup).
  * INSERT statements (data backup).
    
**Logical Recovery**

******Involves:******

  * Recreating the table using the backup of the structure.
  * Populating the table with the data from the backup using INSERT statements.

**4. Tools Used**

***SQL Commands***

  * Core SQL queries like SHOW CREATE TABLE, SELECT, and DESCRIBE.
    
***External Tools***

  * Tools like mysqldump for automated and comprehensive backups

**5. Validation Steps**

  * Verify table structure (DESCRIBE).
  * Compare row counts (COUNT(*)).
  * Inspect data (SELECT *).
